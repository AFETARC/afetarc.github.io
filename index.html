                        <p>AFE TARC is a homeschool team participating in the Team America Rocketry Challenge for
                            their first time. We built and flew rockets in an attempt to complete the TARC goal:
                            to launch a raw egg to 800 feet and return it in 47 seconds intact.</p>

                Our team built 4 rockets to fly in the competition. The design consists of a 18" booster section and
                22" payload section, weighing in at around 17 oz without the motor. Per the design requirements, the
                booster section and payload section with the egg and altimeter land on two separate parachutes, a
                16" Fruity Chute for the payload and 24" Estes parachute for the booster. Motors used were Cesaroni
                Pro24 2 Grain reloads, we flew both the F51-6 Blue Streak and F70-7 White Thunder for various flights.
                The four boosters have the designations X, Y, Z, and ∆, and were flown with either payload X or payload
                Y (only two payloads were built).

            <p>We flew our first flights at Snow Ranch on Feburary 14, 2015. The first flight (below) was an F70-7,
                but we also flew an F51-6. These two flights were very promising with altitudes in the 802 to 790 foot
                range, but we encountered some parachute tangling issues.</p>

                The next flights were February 21st at Moffett Field, and these were our first flights with the
                Y booster and Y payload. The Y booster went 78 feet over the 800 foot target and exhibited unstable
                spiraling known as "coning" so we decided to retire the Y booster. The other flight used the X booster
                and hit a reasonable 828 feet. Recovery was nominal on both flights.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our final set of flights were on March 21, 22, and 29. We flew the new booster Z and flew 3 more
                practice flights, with very close altitudes but descent times that were a bit long. The 4th and final
                flight of the day was our first qualification flight, one of the three flights the team gets a score
                for. This flight hit an excellent 801 feet with a duration of 52 seconds, longer than the target 47
                seconds.

            <p>Flights on March 22 were less than ideal. The rocket using the Z booster flew around 50 feet lower than
                planned for the first two flights. Swapping in the payload section for the Y payload turned in a perfect
                flight to 806 feet. However, the final flight of the day and second qualification flight did not go
                well. The rocket veered off course clearing the launch pad and continued to spiral rapidly until the
                motor burnt out.</p>

                Post-flight analysis revealed that the motor mount had bent on landing on a previous flight causing an
                off-axis line of thrust for the qualification flight. So close, yet so far.
            </p>

            <p>
                The final flights on March 29 went very well. We had built a new booster, ∆, and flew three practice
                flights getting it right into the 800 foot range with 46-48 second descent times, although the two
                parachutes did tangle a few times, leading to some on-site parachute configuration redesign. We called
                our final qualification flight and had what's called a motor cato (catastrophe at take off). The rocket
                launched perfectly until about .75 seconds into the burned at around 300 feet where the motor exploded,
                sending the payload and booster flying out of control (fortunately both parachutes opened). Normally a
                qualification flight can't be canceled, but since the motor exploded we were allowed a retry. We had to
                repair the burnt booster but it was still flyable, and switch to an F70-7 as we were out of F51s. With a
                bit of weight added to compensate for the extra impulse of the F70, we launched again for our final
                qualification flight. The flight went almost perfectly to 811 feet with a time of 47 seconds! A perfect
                end to our TARC finals.
